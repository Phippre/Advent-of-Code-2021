# Advent-of-Code-2021
My Advent of Code Experience ;-;

First year of Advent of Code (2021)

Never done this before and currently trying my hardest. Code here will initially be really rough and unorganized while the event is going on.
I'll take my time afterwards cleaning everything up to make it usuable for other people to check out (Cause apparently I can't write good code the first time).

Advent of Code is a yearly ?Competition?, well, I guess more like a friendly, light-hearted one. It has a leaderboard, but everyone is there for the fun.
The event starts the first day of December and goes up until the 25th. 
I believe it picks a theme and you program to solve the problem in the theme. Each new problem is released everyday for you to solve and as it goes on, it gets harder.

This years theme happens to be a submarine. I have seen some data analysis that throws some curve balls and some complex fun games as well.
